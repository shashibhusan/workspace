Sometimes we need to define multiple beans of the same type.
In these cases, the injection will be unsuccessful because Spring has no clue which bean we need.
We already saw an option to deal with this scenario: marking all the wiring points with @Qualifier and specify the name of the required bean.
However, most of the time we need a specific bean and rarely the others.
We can use @Primary to simplify this case: if we mark the most frequently used bean with @Primary it will be chosen on unqualified injection points.
